# Luxas

### Autonomous research agent — reads papers, runs experiments, writes LaTeX reports end to end.

<br>

Luxas is an open-source, multi-agent system for **autonomous scientific research**. Give it a topic in `RESEARCH.md` and it crawls the literature (OpenAlex, arXiv, CrossRef, paywalled venues via an anti-detect browser) and reads the papers it found. Then it designs and runs experiments — with impl and tests written by sibling agents blind to each other — and produces publication-grade figures from the raw results. Finally it writes a LaTeX report, submits it to adversarial content + figure + layout review, and emits a compiled PDF with real citations. Multi-hour, crash-recoverable, no human in the loop.

**Luxas is a harness, not a model.** The intelligence comes from Claude (Anthropic; Opus / Sonnet / Haiku across roles) and OpenAI o3 for math, with one-line family-wide redirect to DeepSeek-v4 (~10× cheaper, 1M context) or Kimi via an env variable.

Luxas' job is to give that intelligence a durable workspace: file-backed memory (no embeddings, no vector store), externalized brain state, detached Node sub-agent processes, an independent-author pattern that blocks self-review pathologies, and deterministic finish-gates that no prompt can talk past.

Built on top of [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) — Mario Zechner's agent-loop / tool-lifecycle / hook primitives, vendored as `.tgz` under `vendor/`. See [Comparison](#comparison) for how Luxas differs from LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGPT, Sakana AI Scientist, and Claude Code.

## Example Reports

*Skip to [Quick Start](#quick-start) if you came to install.*

Nine end-to-end runs are browsable at [luxas.im/gallery](https://luxas.im/gallery) — each is the full PDF the agent produced from a single one-line topic, including citations, self-generated figures, and adversarial-review notes:

- **Topological Quantum Error Correction** — a survey of QEC codes, thresholds, and experimental realizations
- **Mechanical loss of neutral atoms from optical tweezers** during fluorescence imaging — semi-classical simulation + imaging protocol optimization
- **Ultra-fast trap-free imaging of neutral atoms** in optical tweezer arrays — feasibility analysis across atomic species
- **Microwave superradiance in square arrays of Rydberg atoms** — cooperative decay + eigenvalue analysis + blackbody-triggered collective emission
- **Beyond the Fermi–Hubbard model** — high-temperature superconductivity in cold-atom quantum simulators
- **Dipolar supersolid with ultracold polar molecules** — microwave-shielded NaCs experimental pathway
- **Superradiance in 1D waveguide QED** — numerical investigation of collective emission
- **Raman transitions in 87Rb via a 3.4 GHz EOM** — viability vs the standard 6.8 GHz approach
- **Fast fluorescence imaging of single atoms** — bridging the speed gap between optical lattices and tweezers

Each started from a single `luxas init --prompt "..."` and ran end-to-end with no human writing in the manuscript itself. A few required restarts or `pi_pushback.md` iterations when the reviewer and brain genuinely disagreed; the harness is built around those crashes rather than against them.

## Quick Start

### Before you run — system dependencies

`npm install` alone is not enough; agents shell out to LaTeX, Python, and tmux. Install once:

```bash
# macOS
brew install --cask mactex   # or basictex for ~150MB
brew install poppler tmux python@3.11
pip3 install matplotlib numpy

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended poppler-utils tmux python3-matplotlib python3-numpy
```

### Install + first run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Muuuun/luxas.git && cd luxas
npm install && npm link    # `luxas` now on PATH; skip & use `npx tsx src/index.ts` instead

export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."        # default; also DEEPSEEK_API_KEY / KIMI_API_KEY for non-Claude

luxas init ~/research/x --prompt "Survey LLM chain-of-thought reasoning"
luxas run  ~/research/x --model opus
luxas status  ~/research/x      # check progress
luxas figures ~/research/x      # rerun only figure / typesetter loop
luxas list                      # all projects Luxas has ever touched
```

### Switching models

```bash
luxas run ~/research/x                          # default — every agent uses its declared frontmatter model (full Claude)
luxas run ~/research/x --profile dual           # canonical preset: deepseek-v4-pro text + glm-5.3-flash vision (auditor stays on Claude)
luxas run ~/research/x --model deepseek-v4-pro  # same family-wide redirect as --profile dual but no vision override (figures break)
luxas run ~/research/x --model opus             # brain-only override (sub-agents follow their own .md)
```

`--profile dual` and any `--model deepseek-*` redirect every agent that declared `haiku/sonnet/opus` to the deepseek model via `applyProfile()` in `src/agents/spawn.ts`. Provider-specific picks (`gpt-5.2` for the `math` agent, `o3` for reasoning) bypass — those are deliberate. Vision-required agents (`illustrator` / `illustrator_write` / `typesetter`) need a separate vision profile because the DeepSeek *text* models cannot see; `--profile dual` sets it to `glm-5.3-flash`, which drew the best figure of three models tested at a twentieth of Sonnet's cost. `figure_auditor` is deliberately left on its Anthropic tier: it is the ship/no-ship eye, and an auditor running the same model that drew the figure is not an independent one. `--profile claude` leaves all of them on Anthropic.

Anecdotal cost per full run (check `<project>/.agent/usage.log` for real numbers):

| Profile | $/run | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Default (full Claude) | $20–80 | Best content quality; only profile with Anthropic prompt caching |
| `--profile dual` (DeepSeek text + DeepSeek vision) | $2–10 | Loses ephemeral `cache_control`; figures via DeepSeek's multimodal model |

## How It Works

### Five layers, assembled from pi-agent-core

Luxas vendors four [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) packages as `.tgz` in `vendor/` and assembles them into a research agent:

| Layer | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **System prompt** | `src/agents/definitions/brain.md` | 3 cache-controlled blocks — methodology body (1h cache), RESEARCH.md + skills (cache), `<active_agents>` + `<plan_status>` (mutable, in-place rebuild) |
| **Tools** | `src/tools/` | `read`/`write`/`edit`/`bash`, `compile_latex`, `init_report`, `spawn_agent`, `idle`, `request_pi_review`, figure-gen, `wolfram`, `finish` |
| **Context transform** | `src/context.ts` | Per-agent dynamic context, two-stage compaction (60K warning → 80K compress with summary carry-over) |
| **Hooks** | `src/hooks.ts` | RESEARCH.md write-protect, cost limit (`process.exit` on exceed), search rate limit, per-turn logging, state snapshots |
| **PI fallback monitor** | `src/pi-agent.ts` | Schedules `reviewer` sub-agent every 50 turns and on milestone tool calls — Opus persona that reads project state and submits `continue` / `steer` / `stop` to `reviews/pi_feedback.md` |

### Stateless harness — every layer of state has a file

Brain accounting (cost, tokens, PI counters, compaction markers) is reverse-scanned from `log.jsonl` on restart. Sub-agents are detached Node processes with their own conversation files; brain talks to them via `active-agents.json` and harvests via heartbeat + orphan recovery on resume. The `idle` tool blocks the brain at zero LLM cost while background work runs. Per-project memory lives in `notes/*.md` (smart-truncated when over budget); cross-project memory in `~/.sisyphus/{projects.json,memory.md}` is auto-injected into new project context.

### Experiment workflow (Design → Impl + Review → Integrate)

The `experiment` agent doesn't write code itself. Three phases:

1. **Design** — list each tool needed (name, description, input/output shape).
2. **Impl + Review** — for every tool, spawn `tool_impl` (writes `scripts/<tool>.py` from the description alone) and `tool_review` (writes `tests/test_<tool>.py` from the description alone) in parallel, blind to each other. Pytest is the only ground truth; `SendMessage` ferries failures back to `tool_impl` for fixes (3-revision cap).
3. **Integrate** — run the validated tools, land `data/experiments/<EXP_ID>/runs/run_N/results.json`, append a `## L2.X` section to `notes/experiments.md`.

After return, the harness auto-spawns `experiment_reviewer` for adversarial post-hoc audit (`satisfied` / `revise`).

The blind impl+test split blocks the self-circular failure where impl-and-test are written together (the impl redefines a field's semantics so its self-reported value passes its own assertion — observed live: `max_pair_distance_um` got redefined as post-move distance = 0; tests passed; the tool was wrong).

### Commitment ledger: plan as authority, PI gates closure

`notes/plan.md` is the commitment source of truth — each `### E_N` heading is a hard commitment. `notes/experiments.md` is the audit log — each `## L2.N` section is the experiment agent's record with `Status: Complete` / `Pending`. Two aligned gates enforce closure: the `finish` tool blocks unless every `### E_N` has a matching `## L2.N` with `Status: Complete`, and the reviewer cannot issue `stop` while any active plan `### E_N` is missing or non-Complete. Aligned at both layers, so a "STOP after Pending → brain deadlocked" race is structurally impossible.

Two more invariants: scope reduction is `plan.md`-only — prose like "(Descoped)" next to an `### E_N` heading does not remove it; and `Deferred` is not a status (removed Apr-26 after observed abuse as a soft escape hatch). The brain-write-lock on `notes/experiments.md` (only experiment agents may append) is the [Safety](#safety) table's `notes/experiments.md write lock` row.

### Finalize loop (figures + layout)

Before any `stop` verdict, the reviewer runs `<figure_finalize_loop>`: enumerate `\includegraphics` from `report.tex`, spawn one `illustrator` per source script to regenerate against `report/figures/style_guide.md`, one global-audit `illustrator` for figure-internals (palette / spines / typography / clipping) → `reviews/illustrator_notes.md`, one `typesetter` to rasterize the PDF page-by-page for document-level issues (float distance, caption integrity, column overflow, missing-file red boxes) → `reviews/typesetter_notes.md`. Loop breaks only when both notes report `status: all-clear`; the `<figure_convergence>` tag in reviewer context short-circuits re-audits of unchanged artifacts.

## Comparison

Closest neighbours fall into two groups. **Research-domain-specific agents** (deep-research / AI-scientist class): Sakana's AI Scientist runs ML-benchmark experiments end-to-end but doesn't do literature surveys with citations. **General agent frameworks**: LangGraph (declarative graphs), CrewAI (role-based crews), AutoGPT (LLM-driven control). Claude Code is the single-session coding agent.

Luxas is **research-domain-specific** with a compiled-PDF-with-real-citations as the deliverable (not arbitrary text or code), **file-backed and crash-recoverable** (replays from `log.jsonl`, no in-process state), and **multi-model out of the box** (one env var redirects the whole Anthropic family to DeepSeek-v4 or Kimi).

| | Luxas | AI Scientist (Sakana) | LangGraph | CrewAI | AutoGPT | Claude Code |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Control flow | file-based + hook-enforced gates | scripted pipeline | declarative graph you build | role-based crew | LLM-driven (fragile) | one chat session |
| Crash-recoverable | ✓ stateless harness, replays from `log.jsonl` | ✗ | ✓ via checkpointer (SQLite/Postgres) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Detached sub-agents | ✓ Node processes + heartbeat + orphan recovery | ✗ | ✗ in-process | ✗ in-process | ✗ | ✗ |
| Multi-model native | Claude + DeepSeek + GLM + OpenAI o3 via one env var | OpenAI / Anthropic | DIY plumbing | DIY plumbing | OpenAI-focused | Anthropic-only |
| Output artifact | compiled LaTeX PDF with `\resultref` number-provenance | LaTeX paper from ML experiments | whatever you wire | whatever you wire | text + files | text + code |
| Literature survey | ✓ OpenAlex/arXiv/CrossRef/paywall browser | ✗ (uses cached refs) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Adversarial self-review | content + figure-internal + PDF-layout, three layers | reviewer agent (single layer) | none built-in | none built-in | none | none |

**When to use Luxas**: you have a research topic, want a literature survey or small-scale computational study, and the deliverable is a compiled report with real citations and figures. Reproducible, auditable (every number traces to a JSON key via [provref](https://github.com/Muuuun/provref)), runs unattended for multiple hours.

**When NOT to use Luxas**: you want a general-purpose agent framework you can graft onto arbitrary tasks (use LangGraph or pi-agent-core directly), or you want an interactive coding session (use Claude Code).

## Agents

14 agent types — `brain` plus 13 sub-agent kinds. Each lives in `src/agents/definitions/<name>.md` (YAML frontmatter + markdown body); adding an agent or changing its permissions is one `.md` edit. Three execution modes from `spawn_agent`: **foreground** (blocks, returns result), **parallel** (`tasks: [...]` — N concurrent), **background** (`background: true` — detached, harvested on next turn). Spawn depth capped at 2 (`MAX_SPAWN_DEPTH` in `src/agents/spawn.ts`).

| Agent | Model | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **brain** | Opus (high) | Main driver. Decomposes RESEARCH.md, surveys literature, sequences experiments, writes the report, iterates on PI feedback |
| **search** | Sonnet | Literature discovery — OpenAlex / arXiv / CrossRef / citation chains / web / anti-detect browser for paywalls |
| **reader** | Sonnet | Per-paper extraction → `notes/literature.d/<paper>.md` fragments; hook merges back into canonical `notes/literature.md` |
| **worker** | Sonnet | Lightweight parallel worker — batch downloads, file ops |
| **experiment** | Opus (high) | 3-phase orchestrator (Design → Impl+Review → Integrate). Spawns tool_impl + tool_review per tool; never writes code itself |
| **tool_impl** | Sonnet | Writes `scripts/<tool>.py` from the description only. Cannot read tests |
| **tool_review** | Sonnet | Writes `tests/test_<tool>.py` from the description only. Cannot read impl. ≥1 adversarial test per tool |
| **experiment_reviewer** | Opus (medium) | Auto-spawned post-experiment. Reads L2.X section, results, cited literature; verdict `satisfied` / `revise` |
| **math** | OpenAI o3 | Symbolic derivation via Wolfram Engine (`wolframscript`); sympy fallback |
| **illustrator** | Sonnet (high) | Figure-internal audit + regeneration. Hybrid Gemini-image (Nano Banana) raster + TikZ pipeline; 11 templates |
| **illustrator_write** | Sonnet (medium) | Domain-aware first-pass plot script from raw experiment data |
| **typesetter** | Sonnet (medium) | Document-level layout auditor. Rasterizes PDF pages → notes; catches float distance, caption split, column overflow |
| **reviewer** | Opus (medium) | Adversarial PI. Runs `figure_finalize_loop` before any `stop`. Returns `continue` / `steer` / `stop` |
| **fixer** | Haiku (low) | Mechanical LaTeX compile-error fixer — single-edit + recompile loop |

### Defining an agent

Each `.md` is YAML frontmatter + system prompt body. Key fields:

```yaml
name: tool_impl
model: sonnet                                  # opus|sonnet|haiku|gpt-5.2|deepseek-v4-pro|deepseek-v4-flash|deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp|inherit
thinkingLevel: medium                          # off|low|medium|high
toolSets: [coding]                             # named tool-set factories
templates: [PROJECT_DIR, EXPERIMENT_ID, TOOL_NAME]
spawn: { enabled: false }                      # or { allowedTypes: [reader, math] }
safety:
  presets: [research_brief, report_surface, notes_ledger]
  allowedReadRoots: ["data/experiments/{{EXPERIMENT_ID}}"]
  writeOnExistingPolicy: block
```

`buildSafetyWrapper` compiles this into runtime tool-layer checks. `validateSpawnGraph` runs DFS on `allowedTypes` edges at startup and throws on declared cycles. Adding an agent or changing scope is an `.md` edit; no TypeScript change required.

## Skills

Skills live in `skills/` (Agent Skills standard: `SKILL.md` + scripts):

| Skill | What it's for |
|---|---|
| `search/` | Paper discovery — OpenAlex/arXiv/CrossRef, citation chains, arXiv LaTeX source, figure extraction, Brave web search, anti-detect browser |
| `figure/` | Hybrid figure pipeline — Gemini-image (Nano Banana) raster + rembg background strip + TikZ vector assembly, 11 TikZ templates, per-domain palettes/pitfalls |
| `venue-specific/` | 30+ journal/conference styles (Nature, Science, PRL, NeurIPS, ICML) with matching matplotlib styles + BibTeX |
| `review/` | Survey discipline — 10-domain style guide, anti-stacking rules, outline-first/synthesis-rewrite pipeline |
| `survey-methodology/` | Methodology above `review/` — claim taxonomies, evidence weighting, coverage scoring |
| `memory/` | Cross-project memory protocol — `~/.sisyphus/memory.md` + per-project `notes/` |

---

## Safety

Every constraint is a hook, a tool guard, a frontmatter-declared scope, or a finish-gate — not a prompt instruction. Brain cannot talk its way out.

| Limit | Default | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| Max cost per run | unbounded (`--max-cost` to set); `process.exit(1)` on exceed | `hooks.ts` |
| Max LLM turns | 500 (replaced wall-clock 8h after a $70 stuck-loop) | `agent.ts` |
| PI review fallback | every 50 turns without a brain-triggered review | `pi-agent.ts` |
| Max sub-agent spawn depth | 2 | `agents/spawn.ts` |
| Spawn graph acyclicity | declared cycles throw at startup | `agents/registry.ts::validateSpawnGraph` |
| `RESEARCH.md` write-protect | declared `safety.presets: [research_brief]` | every writing agent's `.md` |
| Per-agent read/write scope | `safety.presets` + `protectedFiles` + `allowedReadRoots`; default `writeOnExistingPolicy: block` | compiled by `buildSafetyWrapper` |
| `finish` gate stack | no bg agents + every `### E_N` Complete in `experiments.md` + report.pdf exists + ≥1 self-generated figure + `typesetter_notes.md` `all-clear` + PI verdict `stop` or fresh `pi_pushback.md` | `tools/index.ts` |
| PI STOP precondition | reviewer cannot `stop` while any active `### E_N` is non-Complete — mirrors finish gate one layer up | `reviewer.md` `<verdict_rules>` |
| `notes/experiments.md` write lock | brain cannot write/edit/heredoc-bash; only experiment agents may append | `safety.protectedFiles` + bash write-guard |

The `finish` tool is the only clean exit; anything else is a crash and the harness is designed to survive crashes. The `pi_pushback.md` escape lets brain defensibly disagree with PI (must be written *fresher* than the disputed feedback).

## FAQ

**How much does it cost per run?**
Anecdotally $20–80 on the default full-Claude profile and $2–10 on `--profile dual` (DeepSeek text + DeepSeek vision). Topic depth and reviewer iteration count dominate the spread. Every run's actual token usage lands in `<project>/.agent/usage.log`; check there for real numbers. See the cost table in [Switching Models](#switching-models).

**How is this different from a single long Claude Code session?**
Claude Code is one agent in one chat. Luxas is a brain spawning 13 sub-agent types (see [Agents](#agents)) as detached processes, with file-based state, deterministic finish gates, and crash-recovery. Full side-by-side in [Comparison](#comparison).

**How do I add a new agent?**
Drop a new `.md` into `src/agents/definitions/`. Declare `model`, `thinkingLevel`, `toolSets`, `templates`, `spawn`, and (if it writes) `safety`. No TypeScript change — `validateSpawnGraph` sanity-checks the graph on next startup; the agent is immediately visible to `spawn_agent`.

**Why do `illustrator` and `typesetter` exist as separate agents?**
They audit orthogonal axes. `illustrator` reads single figure PNGs against a 12-item style checklist; `typesetter` reads rasterized PDF pages for document-level issues (figure float distance, caption integrity, column overflow). Conflating them either bloats one prompt or leaves layout regressions invisible — observed live: a figure source-block 30+ lines below its first `\ref` floated to the wrong page; no agent flagged it until a human did.

**What happens if I crash the brain mid-run?**
Re-run `luxas run <dir>`. The harness detects `checkpoint.jsonl`, replays the session, reconstructs brain state (cost / tokens / PI counters) from reverse-scanning `log.jsonl`, and resumes. Sub-agents kept running (they're detached); their results are recovered on the next turn via orphan recovery in `agent.ts`.

**Why does the reviewer run separately instead of inline?**
Brain asking itself "am I done?" is useless. A separate Opus instance with no access to the brain's reasoning traces and a forced `figure_finalize_loop` before any STOP produces adversarial feedback at three layers (content + figure-internal + layout), not agreement. Its verdict lands in `reviews/pi_feedback.md` and `finish` is gated on it.

**Does this actually work?**
Nine end-to-end runs are linked under [Example Reports](#example-reports) — they compile, cite real papers, include self-generated figures, and converge under adversarial review. Whether *publication-quality* depends on model + topic + reviewer iterations, not on the harness; no SOTA claims.

---

## Security

Luxas runs Python, shell commands, and `pip install` autonomously inside project directories; sub-agents are detached processes that may run for hours unsupervised. Treat any project directory as if it were executed code: don't point Luxas at directories holding credentials, and don't run as root. Credential surfaces are guarded — read/write/edit/bash wrappers block access to `~/.sisyphus/auth.json`, `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.ssh/id_*`, and common API-key env vars (`src/agents/safety-wrappers.ts`) — but this is defense-in-depth, not a sandbox.

Security issues (sandbox escape, credential leak through agent output, command injection through a tool argument): open a GitHub issue tagged `security` rather than disclosing publicly first.
